Originially, this was the backend made for my Go Fare Calculator using Flask, 
unfortunately I had no access to host it in a public domain so I had to default
to run it in a static website.

Regardless of whether or not the website uses a flask backend now it still helped learn a ton of things in full stack development, which is something I hadn't done before up till now
